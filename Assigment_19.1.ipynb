    "#Null Hypothesis: The two categorical variables (Gender, Education Level) are independent.\n",

    "#The chi-square test statistic is calculated by using the formula:\n",
    "#χ2=∑(O−E)2/E\n",
    "#where O represents the observed frequency. E is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis and computed by:\n",
    "# E=row total × column total /sample size\n",
    "#We will compare the value of the test statistic to the critical value of χ2α with degree of freedom = (r - 1) (c - 1), and reject the null hypothesis if χ2>χ2α.\n",
